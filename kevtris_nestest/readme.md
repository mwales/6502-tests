This test was suggested by the [nesdev.com wiki](http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/Emulator_tests)
as a good general purpose 6502 CPU test.  It says the author is kevtris.  It
also linked to the output of running this on another known accurate emulator
so I can compare the execution of my emulator to it.

## Instructions (copied from NES Dev wiki) 

Fairly thoroughly tests CPU operation. This is the best test to start with when
getting a CPU emulator working for the first time. Start execution at $C000 and
compare execution with a log from Nintendulator, an emulator whose CPU is known
to work correctly (apart from some details of the power-up state).
